#How to use Thyme2Eat
Welcome, and thank you for trying out Thyme2Eat. 

In order to get started, make your way to the SETTINGS, easily located using the navigation drawer on the top left corner of the screen. There, you can set the following preferences (cuisine, diet, allergies, foods to include, foods to exclude, as well as the number of dependents). Make sure you remember to press CONFIRM. These preferences will be used to determine the best recipies for you. If you are not sure about what preferences you want, you can skip this step. 

Next, make your way back to the MEAL PLAN using the navigation drawer again. When you are here, press the ADD MEALS button. This will direct you to a calendar view where you can choose which dates you want to plan meals for. (You can only chose future dates). After you have chosen your dates, press CONFIRM. This will bring you back to the MEAL PLAN screen. From here, wait until your new meal plan loads. 

With your new meal plan, you have several options. You can change the dates, change the time, or delete each of the recipes that you have in your plan. Otherwise, you can click on each recipe to bring you to VIEW RECIPE. Here you have the option to either view the ingredients or the recipe.

When you add a recipe to your meal plan, all of the ingredients and their amounts are automatically added to the shopping list. To access the shopping list, simpily go to the SHOPPING LIST in the navigation drawer. There, you can check off items that you have purchased, delete items that you no longer want, or add other items that you wish to purchase.
